			<p>In the Tasman Sea, the name of this surf break speaks for itself.

At Shipstern Bluff, the chances of getting out of there alive on a big day are lower than the chances of riding wipeout-free monsters.

But what makes this surf break so dangerous and scary is definitely its famous "step."<div>

Shipstern Bluff is a mutant wave that creates a wave within a wave due to the shape of the reef bottom. When steps emerge, surfers are forced to handle the jumps as a heavy and fast-breaking lip falls over.

Tasmania's most fearful surf spot can only be accessed by either a 30-kilometer jet ski or a boat ride or a two-hour hike through the Tasman National Park.</div>

			<p>jimmy Mavericks is a brutal A-frame wave that breaks off Pillar Point, in Half Moon Bay, at Princeton-by-the-Sea, in Northern California.

Mavs is one of the most popular big wave surf spots among heavy chargers because it challenges everyone's anxiety, fear, and confidence levels.<span style="color:#616161;">

But there's more. California's liquid, life-and-bone breaker roars to life in cold and shark-infested waters.

With a thick lip and an inside section that ca be tricky to negotiate, Mavericks has already claimed lives.</span>
